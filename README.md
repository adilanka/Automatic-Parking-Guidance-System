# Automatic-Parking-Guidance-System
<b>Motivation</b>
The main motivation which motivated us to do so is the necessity of finding a parking for our cars.
I was thinking that even after so much growth in technology we still had to take tension of parking
but I knew that technology is the solution of this problem too and this made us motivated to build a
parking guidance system and after that we were thinking about what were some of the other
activities and problems which we could solve using bots and technology and all these motivations
has landed us to build this project.
